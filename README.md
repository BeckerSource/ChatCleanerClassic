CCleanerClassic is a customizable chat filter for WoW Classic (based on the BadBoy CCleaner addon).

This was created mainly for eliminating unwanted chat in channels like "LookingForGroup".
If affected channel names are not specified, filtering takes place on all channels, including say and yell chats.

Use /ccc to open the options panel.

Features:
> Option to filter or allow "friendly" players (friends, guildies, etc).
> Option to match keywords as whole words (rather than partial).
> Specify channels by name to be affected by the filtering (example: LookingForGroup).
> Optional "required" keywords which forces a chat to have at least one keyword in the list to be present to be shown.
> Main clean keywords list.

This project was inspired by and includes code from the BadBoy CCleaner addon: \
