Changes in this repo add the additional features:
> Option to filter or allow "friendly" players (friends, guildies, etc).

> Option to match keywords as whole words (rather than partial).

> Specify channels by name to be affected by the filtering (example: LookingForGroup).

> Optional "required" keywords which forces a chat to have at least one keyword in the list to be present to be shown.

> Added "Clear All" buttons for both keyword lists.

> Fixed a lua error caused from the backdrop frame calling a template that doesn't exist ("BackdropTemplate").

> Increased size of main BadBoy frame to compensate for new options.

> Moved saved variables to per-character, rather than account-wide.
